# UKRSIBBANK-Presentation-Day
A Presentation on Facial Recognition and AI usage for the retail sphere

Yesterday, on the 7th July, I was a speaker at the UKRSIBBANK Procurement Day 2019.
A theme of the speech was 'How to integrate with customers via AI'

That was a blast! And here are the examples of code I have shown based on TensorFlow. 

Full speech can be found on YouTube (upload soon)
